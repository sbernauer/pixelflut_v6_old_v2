make --trace

This command will fail. Copy the linking part with gcc and append `pkg-config --libs sdl2 libvncserver` (with quotes) to the command.
Be careful: Only copy one (the first) gcc command, this is a long line. It looks kind of:

gcc -o pixelflut_v6_server -m64 -pthread [...],-Map=pixelflut_v6_server.map -Wl,--cref
Change it to
gcc -o pixelflut_v6_server -m64 -pthread [...],-Map=pixelflut_v6_server.map -Wl,--cref `pkg-config --libs sdl2 libvncserver`
and execute it
